**Link to the website you wanna see support for:** 

Please make sure that you:

- [ ] Checked before if the website is not impossible to implement: see [the other issues](https://github.com/gwennlbh/smooth-cursorify/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20).
- [ ] If I know how to do it, checked that the site does not use a `<textarea>` for its text entry (you can do so by right-clicking the place where the cursor is, and click on "Inspect element" -- it'll show the current code that represents the page, with the element you clicked selected. If that element starts with `<textarea`, smooth cursorify cannot modify the cursor)
